## API connected responsive e-commerce using:
##### Angular 13(Routing, Service, ActivatedRoute, HttpClient, LocalStorage, Binding)
##### scss 

#### How it works:
- Products' data will not be fetched until the global "yellow" sync button is clicked.
- once it fetch, it will be stored using LocalStorage so there isn't more API requests.
- Products can be filtered by clicking the desired category name from the side-Nav.
- by clicking product sync button will redirect the router to productDetailsPage 
which include the selected products information.
- in small scale viewPort, the side-Nav will be turned to a small tab on the right 
and it will be showed up by clicking on it.
